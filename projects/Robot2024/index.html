        I have always wanted to make some sort of robot, or something akin to one.  My oppourtunity
        came my second year of college when my friend Finn asked if I wanted to help him with one.
        I jumped at the oppoutunity and we started cadding, and coming up with ideas.
        <p>
          We started with just coming up with how the drive train would work, what motors and general size
          of the bot.
        </p>
        <p>
          We settled on a 16 square inch frame, and decided on using a simple tank drive, where one center wheel is driven
          by a motor, and 2 smaller wheels on either side of the motor are there for support.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came up with a very simple CAD design below of how the robot would rouply look.
